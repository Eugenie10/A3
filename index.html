        <h2>Felidae</h2>
        <p>
            The Felidae family is a part of the order Carnivora within the mammals. Members of the family are called 
cats or felids, and sometimes felines, although this latter term is more precisely used for members of the 
subfamily Felinae. They number about 41 species including large animals such as the lion and the tiger, as 
well as smaller ones such as the bobcat and the domestic cat.
Some cats present a threat to domestic animals, even to humans in the case of the big cats. For such reasons, as well as for sport and fur, cats have been a target of hunters and trappers. Because of such hunting, 
combined with loss of suitable habitat and other causes, most species are now considered to be endangered in the wild.
Felidae are considered to be among the most threatened groups of mammals and larger species like them 
are heavily persecuted because of the danger they pose to humans and livestock. Even the small cat species 
are persucuted and are harvested by human for the fur trade. The International Union for the Conservation 
of Nature (IUCN) Red List designates 29 of 36 wild felid species as having a decreasing population trend. 
Nearly 50% of all felid species are listed in the top three threatened categories, and seven of these species 
are listed as Critically Endangered or Endangered. Felids characterized as threatened are those that appear 
to be naturally rare with limited distribution or those that have become threatened because of human factors. The Iberian lynx, listed as Critically Endangered, fits into both categories and may become the first cat 
species to become extinct in modern times.

          <a class="thumbnail"><img src="black_panther.jpg" alt="Black Panther" data-description="The black panther is of the same species as the spotted panther called the leopard. Unlike the latter, the black panther produces a substance that attaches to the hair and darkens it: melanin. This phenomenon is called melanism. Moreover, when we look at his coat in bright light, we can see the lighter spots (ocelli) that we find on the leopard's fur. In addition, in the same litter, young can be born completely black next to their spotted brothers! The eyes of this animal are an intense green or yellow, contrasting with the jet-black fur. This makes its appearance, admittedly, elegant, but also terrifying and menacing. Moreover, the terror it inspires in us is justified, because it is an extremely aggressive feline. As a very good hunter, the black panther remains perched on a tree branch while patiently waiting for prey to pass below; her black coat also serves as camouflage when she walks in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Silent, she approaches her victim and leaps on it, giving him no chance to escape. Often it hoists its prey in trees to protect them from predators and scavengers. If its victim is fat, she may have to eat for more than eight days!"/></a>
          <a class="thumbnail"><img src="lion.jpg" alt="Lion" data-description="Earth, also called the world[n 5] (and, less frequently, Gaia[n 6] or, in Latin, Terra[26]), is the third planet from the Sun, the densest planet in the Solar System, the largest of the Solar System's four terrestrial planets, and the only astronomical object known to accommodate life. The earliest life on Earth arose at least 3.5 billion years ago."/></a>
          <a class="thumbnail"><img src="tiger.jpg"  alt="Tiger" data-description="The tiger is the most powerful carnivore and the largest of the felines. The two known subspecies are the Siberian tiger and the Bengal tiger. Being nocturnal, it has excellent sight and hearing which enables it to detect his predators in the dark. It is one of the felines that perceive colours. Large predator as it is, its tawny coat is strong and easily remains hidden in the vegetation to surprise a prey. Once it detected it, it suddenly pounced on it. If the prey escapes it, it can run at nearly 50km/h, but over short distances because it becomes exhausted very quickly. Carnivorous, its diet is very varied: deer, cattle, baby elephants, rhinos, birds, frogs, fish and even crocodiles! Territorial, it marks its domain with urine and excrement while scratching the bark of trees in order to repel intruders. Solitary, tigers avoid crossing paths. It is only during the breeding season or when they drink from a rare water point that males and females meet. At birth, the young are blind, but their eyes open after 10 days. The mother nurses them for a month and a half and brings them small preys. It is around 11 months that the young can hunt on their own, but they do not leave their mother until 2 or 3 years old."/></a>
          <a class="thumbnail"><img src="leopard.jpg" alt="Leopard" data-description="Also called a panther, the leopard is recognizable by its fawn-colored fur with unclosed black circles. This dress allows her to go unnoticed in the tall grass. Its tail, which can reach nearly a meter, serves, among other things, as a pendulum to keep its balance when it is in the trees. Agile, it mainly hunts at night on the lookout. Crouching in the tall grass or perched on a branch from which it silently descends, it spots its prey then crawls belly to the ground. Arrived close to her, it leaps on it and kills it with a bite in the neck or in the throat. An excellent runner, he sometimes pursues its victim for several hundred meters; it can reach 60 km/h. Once its prey is killed, it hoists it on a branch or a tree fork to eat it over several days. Thus, it is not disturbed by other predators or scavengers. Thanks to the strength of its jaws and its powerful hind legs, it can drag animals much heavier than itself to more than 5 meters in height in trees. Also, very good swimmer, it happens to eat fish when prey on earth is scarce. Unlike many big cats that live in communities, the leopard enjoys solitude. It has a territory which he delimits by its urine and by scratching the bark of trees. Males and females only meet during the breeding season, which only lasts a maximum of 15 days."/></a>
          <a class="thumbnail"><img src="ocelot.jpg" alt="Ocelot" data-description="The ocelot is a small feline with a very graceful and elegant silhouette. Its yellow or brown coat is marked with broken brown lines edged with black, present on the back and sides. Its belly and legs are white or beige with black markings. Its short-haired fur is ideal for camouflaging itself in the dense vegetation of the forests. Of nocturnal habits, it mainly hunts rodents but, as it is a good climber, it can also attack snakes, iguanas and birds. He is also not afraid to take the plunge and swims very well. Therefore, it supplements its diet with shellfish and fish. During the day, it sleeps in the shelter of a thicket or perched on a branch. Usually solitary, pairs form only during the breeding season, which can occur at any time of the year. After fertilization, gestation lasts less than 3 months. One or two young are born, very rarely three. For almost a year, they stay close to their mother. After which, they leave her in search of new territory. Ocelots live 7 to 10 years in the wild."/></a>
          <a class="thumbnail"><img src="serval.jpg" alt="Serval" data-description="Earth, also called the world[n 5] (and, less frequently, Gaia[n 6] or, in Latin, Terra[26]), is the third planet from the Sun, the densest planet in the Solar System, the largest of the Solar System's four terrestrial planets, and the only astronomical object known to accommodate life. The earliest life on Earth arose at least 3.5 billion years ago."/></a>
          <a class="thumbnail"><img src="lynx.jpg" alt="Lynx" data-description="Earth, also called the world[n 5] (and, less frequently, Gaia[n 6] or, in Latin, Terra[26]), is the third planet from the Sun, the densest planet in the Solar System, the largest of the Solar System's four terrestrial planets, and the only astronomical object known to accommodate life. The earliest life on Earth arose at least 3.5 billion years ago."/></a>
          <a class="thumbnail"><img src="cheetah.jpg" alt="Cheetah" data-description="Born for racing, it is the fastest animal in the world. Its coat and weight are similar to those of the leopard, but its body is more elongated, its head smaller and its legs much longer. He is the only felid to have claws that do not retract when he runs or walks, they stay out all the time. On his face, a black tear-like line runs from each eye to his mouth. These trails allow it to minimize the reflections of sunlight and therefore to see better. Thanks to its extremely flexible spine, the cheetah is able to stretch and arch its back instantly when running or soaring. He can reach 110 km/h in less than 500 meters, but he cannot run at that speed for more than 20 seconds. This is why it must be very close to its prey to be able to catch it (maximum 30 meters away). Females are rather solitary, but males, often brothers, move in small groups. They do not join the females until the moment of mating. At birth, babies are born blind and weigh less than 280 grams. They are around 30 cm long, have a mottled gray coat and their hair is long and silky. They will keep this dress until they are 4 months old. During the first few weeks, the mother moves her young almost every day to avoid predators. Indeed, as she has to go hunting, she cannot watch them all the time!"/></a>
          <a class="thumbnail"><img src="jaguar.jpg" alt="Jaguar" data-description="This big feline is often mistaken for the leopard. But it’s not the case, because the jaguar is bigger, and his fur pattern is different. Like the leopard, it has black, rose-shaped spots (called rosettes), inside of which are other lighter spots. But hers are much larger. Featuring a massive and powerful body, he has a slightly arched back and a wide chest. Its legs are sturdy and its tail relatively short. This beautiful animal has a very varied habitat: it is found in the rainforests of South and Central America, but also in Mexico and as far as the southwest of the United States, in Arizona. It is an excellent hunter, as well in tropical forests as in deserts and savannas. Agile climber and very good swimmer, the jaguar feeds on a wide variety of preys (otters, turtles, fish, rodents, anteaters, monkeys, birds, sheep, large reptiles ...). It usually hunts on the lookout: perched on a tree branch or crouching in dense vegetation, it waits for a victim to pass near it. Its attack is lightning, leaving no chance for its prey. He grabs her and breaks her neck in a split second. Solitary, the jaguar lives in pairs only during the breeding season. The female gives birth to up to 4 cubs which are born blind and weigh about 800 g. After two weeks, the latter open their eyes and begin to hunt around the age of 6 months. They stay with their mother for almost 2 years, after which they leave in search of new territory."/></a>
          <a class="thumbnail"><img src="cougar.jpg" alt="Cougar" data-description="Earth, also called the world[n 5] (and, less frequently, Gaia[n 6] or, in Latin, Terra[26]), is the third planet from the Sun, the densest planet in the Solar System, the largest of the Solar System's four terrestrial planets, and the only astronomical object known to accommodate life.
